README PRAAT-output files

All files with .merged.txt are created with the Software PRAAT, they are simple tables created from so-called TexGrids.

Each files contains the data for one participant, performing one task, in either their L1 or L2.

The first column is the soundfile-ID:
AMGOPP1_L1_Task2.wav is the ID of the participant (AMGOPP1), the langueage (L1 or L2), and the task (Task1 or Task2).
Task1 in L1 is not the exact same task as Task1 in L2, but a very similar task requiring similar linguistic and cognitive demands.

The second column is "tmin": for duration-events, this is the start of the event; for point-events, the start and the end will be the same.

The third column is "tier": the name of the variable. These are the variables related to fluency:
Phrases: interval variable either 0 (speech) or 1 (silent pause)
DFauto (English/Dutch): interval variable which is 1 for a filled pause, and 0 for speech
Nuclei: point variable that is a number counting up, for each nucleus (middle) of a syllable throughout the sound file

The following tiers are all interval-tiers, related to the words, as looked up in an external corpus:
Lg10WF: Log frequency of occurrence in an external corpus (this is the best variable for lexical complexity)
SUBTLEXWF: Fequency per million in external corpus
CDcount: kind of freqency/count in external corpus
FREQlemma: yet another, frequency of the lemma not the word in external corpus
FREQlow: yet another frequency count
SUBTLEXCD: yet another frequency count
Lg10CD: log of a frequency count
CDlow: yet another frequency count
FREQcount: yet another frequency count
POStags: part of speech tag

The following two tiers are also interval-tiers, related to the words
FreqDist: measure for frequency of occurrence within the soundfile itself
Repetitions: measure for repetetiveness of the word until now. It ranges from 0 (word never uttered until now) to 1 (previous word was the same word)

The fourth column is the value of the tier (called 'text')
Phrases: 1 or 0
DFauto: 1 or 0
Nuclei: an absolute number
Lg10WF etc: a number
POStags: a code
FreqDist: a number
Repetitions: a number ranging from 0 to 1

NOTE that sometimes PRAAT outputs "--undefined--" or "MISSING", which you can change to "NA"

The fifth column is 'tmax', which is the same value of 'tmin' for the point tier "Nuclei", and which is the ending time of interval-tiers
